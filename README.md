# tSNE
An implementation of tSNE from scratch, following the algorithm described in the original tSNE paper.

tSNe, or t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, is a machine learning algorithm (unsupervised learning) that is used to reduce the dimensions of data in such a way that we can easily visualize clusters/neighborhoods in high-dimensional data sets.

The algorithm is at its core, gradient descent, but the complicated part in its implementation is implementing the loss function (based on Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence, where we measure the difference between two probability distributions).
