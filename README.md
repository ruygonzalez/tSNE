# tSNE
An implementation of tSNE from scratch, following the algorithm described in the original tSNE paper.

tSNe, or t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, is a machine learning algorithm (unsupervised learning) that is used to reduce the dimensions of data in such a way that we can easily visualize clusters/neighborhoods in high-dimensional data sets.

The algorithm is at its core, gradient descent, but the complicated part in its implementation is implementing the loss function (based on Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence, where we measure the difference between two probability distributions). We view Euclidean distances between points as probabilities in the high dimensional space and we try to find a low-dimensional probability distribution that captures the probability distribution of the high-dimensional space. 

I test out the implementation of tSNE by generating points from a 3-component Gaussian mixture model with centroids that are clearly spaced out in 10-dimensional space, and show that tSNE produces visualizations with 3 clear clusters in 2-dimensional space (moreover, we color the points with the component aka. Gaussian distribution that generated the point to show that the clusters exactly represent the 3 components).
